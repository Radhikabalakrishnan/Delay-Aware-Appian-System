# SLA-Aware Process Entry Control System for Appian

##  Project Overview

This project introduces an intelligent process entry control mechanism for the Appian platform that prevents system overload by dynamically regulating backend workflow initiation based on real-time system load.

---

##  The Problem

Current Appian systems face these challenges:

-  All process requests start immediately
-  System overload during peak times (festivals, month-end)
-  Task queues build up at user nodes
-  SLA violations detected AFTER delays occur
-  Users resubmit forms creating more load
-  No native control mechanism in Appian

**Result:** Poor user experience + Reactive problem handling

---

##  Our Solution

We implement a **traffic control system for business processes**:

 **Accept** user submissions immediately (no blocking)  
 **Store** data instantly (prevents duplicates)  
 **Analyze** system health in real-time  
 **Calculate** optimal wait time  
 **Inform** users transparently  
 **Release** processes gradually  

### Key Innovation:
**Separate user submission from process execution**

---

##  How It Works
```
Step 1: User submits form
   ↓
Step 2: Data stored immediately
   ↓
Step 3: System health check
   ↓
Step 4: Wait-time calculation
   ↓
Step 5: User sees message
   ↓
Step 6: Timer-based queue
   ↓
Step 7: Controlled process start
```

## 🚦 Health Status Logic

| Status | Condition | Wait Time | User Message |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 🟢 Green | System free | 0 min | "Processing starting immediately" |
| 🟡 Yellow | System busy | 8-15 min | "Processing will start after 10 minutes" |
| 🔴 Red | Overloaded | 60+ min | "Processing will start after 1 hour" |

##  Technology Stack

- **Platform:** Appian BPM
- **Components:**
  - Decision Rules (Health check logic)
  - Process Models (Workflow design)
  - Timer Events (Delayed execution)
  - Data Store Entities (Queue storage)
  - Process Analytics (Real-time metrics)
  - User Interfaces (Message display)

##  Real-World Example

### Scenario: Month-End Loan Processing Rush

**Without our solution:**
- 500 applications at 4 PM
- All start immediately
- System crashes
- 300+ SLA breaches

**With our solution:**
- 500 applications accepted
- 100 start now (Green)
- 200 wait 10 min (Yellow)
- 200 wait 1 hour (Red)
- Users informed clearly
- Zero SLA breaches

## 📈 Expected Impact

### For Users:
-  Clear communication
-  No confusion
-  Better experience

### For Organizations:
-  SLA compliance maintained
-  System stability improved
-  Resource optimization

### For Operations:
-  Proactive management
-  Predictable load
-  Reduced escalations
